BigBlueButton LTI Integration
=============================
BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system that enables universities and colleges to deliver a high-quality learning experience to remote students.  

These instructions describe how to install the BBB-LTI Plugin into a BigBlueButton server.

With this plugin you can
    - Enable a BigBlueButton server to be a LTI provider 
    - With a LMS acting as a consumer, allow users to create and join meetings using LMS external tools

Development
=============
bbb-lti is a grails project that can be compiled using the bbb-web components installed in any BigBlueButton development environment.
    
To generate the war file
    grails clean
    grails war

Deployment
=============
Place the war file into the tomcat webapps directory and restart tomcat
        
    sudo cp lti-0.1.war /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/lti.war
       
Configure the properties
        
    sudo vi /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/lti/WEB-INF/classes/lti.properties

Edit the URL and Salt of the BigBlueButton server you are going to connect to
    
    bigbluebuttonURL=http://yourbigbluebuttonserver.com/bigbluebutton
    
    bigbluebuttonSalt=yoursalt
        
Edit the LTI basic information
    
    ltiEndPoint=http://yourbigbluebuttonserver.com/lti/tool.xml
        
    ltiConsumers=demo:welcome,consumer1:secret1
    
Restart tomcat
        
    sudo service tomcat6 restart
        
When running on the BigBlueButton server, create the map to this new application on nginx
    
    

How to use the service
======================
You need:

    1.  A server running any LMS which is a LTI consumer compliant 
    2.  A BigBlueButton 0.8 server running on a separate server (not on the same server as your LMS)
    3.  A server running the plugin (It can be your bigbluebutton server or any other java application server)

Add a new external tool
    In the LMS create a new external tool using the parameters added in the configuration file
    Ej.
    Consumer Key: demo
    Shared Secret: welcome
    URL: http://yourbigbluebuttonserver.com/lti/tool.xml
    
The BigBlueButton roles are assigned according to the roles in the LMS.
